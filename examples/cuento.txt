Once upon a time, in a small village surrounded by mountains, there lived a girl named Ana. Ana was curious and dreamy; she always wondered what lay beyond the hills. She often spent hours looking at the mountains, imagining the adventures she might have if she ever dared to go farther.

In her village, Ana was known for her kindness. She helped her neighbors, cared for animals, and always shared a smile. But despite the happiness she found in helping others, there was also a knot of sadness in her heart. Sometimes the village children did not have enough time to play because their parents were busy working, and that saddened Ana deeply.

One day, she decided to set out and explore the nearby forest. While walking, she found a beautiful stream shining in the sunlight. She sat down to rest and, while looking at the water, saw her reflection. But it was not only her reflection; beside her there was a tiny golden fish.

To her surprise, the fish began to speak: "Hello, Ana. I have been waiting for someone like you. If you free me from this stream, I will grant you three wishes. But be careful, your wishes will affect everyone around you."

Excited and a little skeptical, Ana decided to help the fish. After a brief but brave effort, she managed to free it from an old net. Grateful, the fish kept its promise.

"Ask for whatever you wish, Ana," said the golden fish.

Ana thought for a moment and made her wishes: first, that her village would always have enough food; second, that all the children in the village could play and learn together, building strong friendships; and third, a beautiful garden full of flowers and butterflies where everyone could be happy.

The golden fish smiled and, with a flash of light, granted her wishes. But the process was not simple. At first, the village overflowed with food, but soon people stopped working the land, relying only on the fish's wishes. The children had space to play, but they did not yet know how to care for one another, and their friendships started to fade.

Ana realized wishes were not enough; real happiness required effort and cooperation. She worked herself, organized the children into groups so they could learn to support each other, and helped them play together. Over time, the garden flourished, not only with beautiful flowers, but also with laughter and joy.

Seeing her work tirelessly, the golden fish congratulated her: "Ana, you have learned a valuable lesson. Acts of kindness and teamwork are the true sources of happiness."

From that day on, Ana and the golden fish became friends, and their story was told from generation to generation, reminding everyone that wishes can be a beginning, but true magic is found in how much we are willing to work for our dreams and for others.
